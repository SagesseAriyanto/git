# Fork & Pull Request Workflow

## Repository Access Levels

**Public User (No permissions):**
- Can view and clone
- Cannot push directly
- Must use fork â†’ PR workflow

**Collaborator/Contributor (Write access):**
- Can clone and push directly to original repo
- No fork needed (but can still fork if desired)
- Can create branches and merge PRs

**Owner/Admin:**
- Full control over repository
- Can manage settings and permissions

## Fork Workflow (for non-contributors)
```bash
# 1. Fork on GitHub (creates your copy)
# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/their-repo.git

# 3. Make changes, create branches, commit freely
git checkout -b new-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 4. Push to YOUR fork
git push origin new-feature

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Direct Push Workflow (for contributors)
```bash
# 1. Clone original repo directly
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git

# 2. Make changes and push directly
git checkout -b new-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin new-feature  # No PR needed (but recommended for review)
```

## Key Points
- Fork = for outsiders who want to contribute
- Direct clone = for team members with access
- Contributors can push directly but PRs are still good practice
- Always work in feature branches
