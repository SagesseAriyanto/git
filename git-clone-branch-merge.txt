# Git Basics

## Clone
Creates a local copy of a remote repository with full history and working directory.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
git clone --depth 1 <url>              # Shallow clone
git clone -b <branch> <url>            # Clone FROM their specific branch
```

## Branching
```bash
git branch                             # List all branches (branch with * is current branch)
git branch <name>                      # Create new branch
git checkout <branch>                  # Switch to branch
git checkout -b <name>                 # Create and switch to new branch
git branch -d <name>                   # Delete branch
```

## Merging
```bash
git merge <branch>                     # Merge branch into current branch
git merge --no-ff <branch>             # Merge with merge commit
```

**Merge workflow:**
1. Switch to target branch: `git checkout main`
2. Merge feature branch: `git merge feature-branch`
3. Delete feature branch: `git branch -d feature-branch`

## Push permissions & Ethics

**Contributing to others' repos:**
- **Proper way**: Fork → clone your fork → push → create Pull Request
- **Why fork?** Maintains connection to original, gives credit, follows open source etiquette

**Creating your own repo with their code:**
- ✅ **Legal IF**: Their repo has open source license (MIT, GPL, etc.)
- ❌ **Not okay**: Taking code without license or attribution
- ⚠️ **Best practice**: Always fork instead of copying to new repo

**License matters:**
- Check for LICENSE file in their repo
- MIT/Apache = usually okay to copy with attribution
- No license = all rights reserved (don't copy)
- GPL = must keep same license if you distribute

**Golden rule**: When in doubt, fork and contribute back!
