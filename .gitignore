# Ignore all files with certain extensions
*.log                   # All log files (.log)
*.tmp                   # All temporary files (.tmp)
*.cache                 # All cache files (.cache)

# Ignore entire folders
node_modules/           # Common for JavaScript projects
__pycache__/            # Python cache folder
.vscode/                # VS Code settings folder
build/                  # Build output folder

# Ignore files starting with specific patterns
temp*                   # Files like temp1.txt, tempfile.log, etc.
draft*                  # Files like draft.md, draft-notes.txt, etc.

# Common patterns:
# filename.txt          - Ignore specific file
# *.extension           - Ignore all files with this extension
# folder/               - Ignore entire folder and its contents
# pattern*              - Ignore files starting with "pattern"
# *pattern              - Ignore files ending with "pattern"
# !important.log        - DON'T ignore this file (exception to *.log rule)

# Remember: .gitignore only affects NEW files, not already tracked ones!
